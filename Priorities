1) Get familiar with LeapMotion. We probably should use the Pointable and Gesture classes in the API. "Tapping" should shoot, as the controller seems to have a hard time recognizing both thumb and index finger at the same time. Index finger is a pointable object, so we should use the Vector class to get the vector that extends from it. We will need to import that into Unity whenever a tap is registered.

2) Vectors seem to have a fairly significant vertical limitation-- they can't point up more than about thirty degrees from horizontal. This could potentially be solved by placing the controller on a slope and diagonal to the hand. To do this, however, we need to look into re-orienting the controller. Look into this.

3) When we have the above problems solved, we can begin working with the Oculus in Unity and adding some things to point at.

1.1) Look at UnitySandbox example in SDK. It does a lot of what we need, and we should probably be trying to modify it. Specifically, start with LeapUnitySelectionController class. (C:\Users\jmb113\Downloads\LeapDeveloperKit_release_win_1.0.9+8391\LeapDeveloperKit\Examples\UnitySandbox)
Changing (even completely deleting) this class doesn't seem to affect the way the demo runs. Why?

4/6/14:
meow: copy of UnitySandbox example
meowver1: checkShouldTransform, checkShouldRotate, and checkShouldScale all set to false to remove object manipulation
meowver2: GUI file changed to remove enabling/disabling of manipulation text

4/7/14:
meowver3: change LeapUnityBridge to only recognize one finger
meowver4: look at LeapFingerCollisionDispatcher; try changing KHitDistance and Debug.DrawRay to make ray distance infinite and display it as such. Alternately, try changing updatePointable in LeapUnityHandController.
